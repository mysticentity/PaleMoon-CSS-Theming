This is a for fun project I was doing to try and repurpose an old firefox theme from the early 2000's to Pale Moon Browser.

Link to any original sources are quite hard to find online so what you see here under scr is for the most part the unpacked original .xpi file.

Of course I have made some changes to the original source to get it to work with pale moon but most of what used to be there is still left.
