This is a for fun project I was doing to try and repurpose an old firefox theme from the early 2000's to Pale Moon Browser.

  Link to any original sources are quite hard to find online so what you see here under scr is for the most part the unpacked original .xpi file.

  Of course I have made some changes to the original source to get it to work with pale moon but most of what used to be there is still left.

1. Show all downloads button has missing BG and or background isn't fully covering.
2. Open Containing folder startcap for the button being hidden/non existant specifically here. Looks fine other places. (outlined in red)
3. URL bar should mimic the search bar and have a transparent background and not this white/off-white color.
